Overall happy with how this looks, the CSS is a mess as I mostly avoided using inline styling to get more used to working on two seperate files, the html and stylesheet at once.

On most desktop resolutions it should be close to enough to fool at least appearance wise in my opinion, but obviously very little functionality. Though I did add hover functions to the main search buttons.
